# Who
> The Home Server Group

# What
> Development of a home server that offers all the options a person would want in a home server, internet service provider, home automation system, media server, file server, and all supporting services, all in one easy to deploy package.

> In a home you expect to find a refrigerator, dishwasher, furnace, and hot water tank.  Running water and electricity and cable or fiber connections are now common and the homes might also have cable or ethernet wires run to major rooms  There may also be an alarm system, a garage door opener with wireless access.

> What is missing is a home server that you install along with your hot water tank or refrigerator when you move in.
